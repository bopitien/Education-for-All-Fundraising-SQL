# Education-for-All-Fundraising-SQL

You’re a Data Analyst working for the charity, 
Education for All. You have been asked by the Head 
of Fundraising to present the data on donor insights 
and donation rates.
Within the Fundraising team, your objectives are to:
• Increase the number of donors in your database
• Increase the donation frequency of your donors.
• Increase the value of donations in your database.
In two weeks your team is having a fundraising 
strategy meeting for the following year, and you need 
to present insights from the donation data to inform 
your fundraising strategy and increase donations.
